Hello, everybody! 👋

And welcome to the 2nd lecture of the **Styled Components 101 series** 🙌

In this lecture, we'll be covering the **creation of a custom theme** with Styled Components.

If you're new to Styled Components and this lecture is the first one you run into, I suggest taking a look at the previous lecture first, where we covered some basic concepts and examples of Styled Components.

With all this said, let's move on to today's topic 👇

## Creating the theme file 🔮

First things first. Before start generating components and other component-related stuff, what we need to do is **create the file** that will host our **app's theme**.

This theme file will be just a regular JavaScript file with js extension that will contain an object called *theme* with properties and values that we'll be using to style our components.

As easy as that 💁‍♂️

Let's have a look at how this file looks like:

`theme.js`

```c
const theme = {
   colors: {
      plum: "#52314b",
      rose: "#c3537d",
      dryrose: "#dd7f9a",
      primrose: "#e8babf",
      white: "#fff"
   }
}

export default theme;
```

For now, we'll be working only with colors, but every property/value you can imagine that is used for styling will also be set in this file: values regarding fonts, padding, margin, etc. In short, every value that you'd set up in a CSS file.

Don't forget to export your theme object. Otherwise, there's no way for it to be found by the app 👍

And that's all for the theme file. We're now set to head on to the next step

## Making the theme file reachable by the app 🕵️

In order for the theme file to be able to be accessed, we need to provide it to the app. To do this, we'll import the component *ThemeProvider* from *styled-components* and will wrap our app with it.

`app.js`

```c
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";
import theme from "./theme";

const App = () => {
   return(
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
         //your code here
      </ThemeProvider>
   )
}
export default App;
```

Now, our theme is recognized by the app and can be accessed and used from anywhere throughout it.

## Using the theme inside a styled component 💅

Retrieving theme values from within a *styled* component is a really easy process, since the theme is **implicit** to the component props.

Let's see how to style a *styled* component making use of a couple values from our custom theme:

`BasicThemedButton.js`

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
   background-color: ${props => props.theme.colors.primrose};
   color: ${props => props.theme.colors.white};
   font-size: 1.25rem;
   border: none;
   border-radius: 5px;
   padding: 10px;

```

Our custom theme is implicitly passed-in as a prop and it's easily accessed because the component is also wrapped by the provider:

`App.js`

```c
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";
import theme from "./theme";
import BasicThemedButton from "./components/BasicThemedButton";

const App = () => {
   return(
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
         <BasicThemedButton>I am a basic themed button! 🤗</BasicThemedButton>
      </ThemeProvider>
   )
}
export default App;
```

## Using the theme inside a custom React component ⚛️

To use our theme inside a custom React component, we need to write a little bit more code, but not a big deal at all.

`ThemedButton.js` ≡ React component

```c
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import StyledButton from "./StyledButton";
import { ThemeContext } from "styled-components";

const ThemedButton = () => {
   const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
   return(
      <StyledButton bgColor={theme.colors.plum} color={theme.colors.white}>I am a themed button 😜</StyledButton>
   )
}

export default ThemedButton;
```

`StyledButton.js` ≡ Styled component

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
   background-color: ${props => props.bgColor};
   color: ${props => props.color};
   padding: 10px;
   border: none;
   border-radius: 5px;
   font-size: 1.25rem;
`
```

This time, the values from the theme are passed to the styled component via **props**, which have been previously retrieved in the React component by making use of the **useContext** hook and the **ThemeContext** component from styled-components.

Note that we'll be calling our React component as we regularly do:

```c
<ThemedButton />
```

## The *theme* prop 🤖

The *theme prop* is used to pass in an inline object that contains the specification for the theme to a styled component.

```c
<StyledButton theme={{bg: theme.colors.primrose, color: theme.colors.white}}>
	I am a button with a theme prop! 😎
</StyledButton>
```

`StyledButton.js`

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
   background-color: ${props => props.theme.bg};
   color: ${props => props.theme.color};
   padding: 10px;
   border: none;
   border-radius: 5px;
`
```

![theme button 3](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N2mZThjB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mmtme1uroaum58rgmdj9.png)

This method can be useful if we don't have many properties, but, when we have a robust application with several properties and values for styling, this method becomes difficult to maintain and tricky to deal with ❌

## Using JavaScript objects to write our styles rather than CSS 🤹‍♀️

Did you know that is also possible to write custom styles using **JS instead of CSS** in Styled Components? And it's easier than you may think.

Let's have a look at the following snippet:

`JSStyledButton.js`

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button(props => ({
   backgroundColor: props.bgColor,
   fontSize: "1.5rem",
   color: props.color
}));
```

```c
<JSStyledButton bgColor={theme.colors.plum} color={theme.colors.white}>
	I am a JS Styled Button 🤠
</JSStyledButton>
```

![theme button 4](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k_wWRmn1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xa3cp7u3luuyoue7x2m3.png)

Notice that property names are written in **camelcase** notation, as we're using a JavaScript object, but it's also accepted to write them within **double quotes**, like this:

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button(props => ({
   "background-color": props.bgColor,
   "font-size": "1.5rem",
   color: props.color
}));
```

Also note that the used method to specify the styles is similar to the one we use when **extending styles from a supercomponent** (*Lecture 1 - Inheriting styles from another component*):

```c
...
export default styled.button(...);
...
```

## And now... 👑 The jewel in the crown: Let's create a Light/Dark theme toggler with Styled Components

Theory is cool but, but let's get our hands dirty and let's create something interesting using themes 👏
### Excuse me, but... what exactly is a theme toggler? 🤔

We can say that a theme toggler is a system that allows to **switch between a light and a dark theme** with just one click by using a button or an emoji. Cool, right?

In this tutorial, we'll implement a styled button that will perform this task really fast and efficiently.

And now, let's get it started 👉

### The components and files 🎬

These are the components and files that will make up our app:

`Button.js`: the button that will switch between themes.

`GlobalStyles.js`: a component that will inject global styles into the app.

`ThemeToggler.js`: the component that will receive the theme as a prop, which, in turn, will be passed in to the *Button* component.

`useDarkTheme`: a custom hook that will contain the business logic.

`App.js`: the main app. It will wrap everything up with the theme provider and will include the global styles.

`themes.js`: the file that will host our themes (we already know how to do this at this point 😺).

## Let's first create our themes file 📝

`themes.js`

```c
export const lightTheme = {
    background: '#fff',
    color: '#1d1f28',
    buttonBg: '#c5718d'
}

export const darkTheme = {
    background: '#1d1f28',
    color: '#fafafa',
    buttonBg: '#515d90'
}
```

Not a lot to remark here: we have defined both themes with their respective style properties. Don't forget to export them both 👍

## Now let's go with the switch button 🔵

`Button.js`

```c
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
   font-family: "Monaco", monospace;
   cursor: pointer;
   border: none;
   background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.buttonBg};
   color: #fff;
   padding: 10px;
   border-radius: 5px;
   font-size: 1.5rem;
`
```

A regular *styled* button. You can style it as you like best.

Note that the value for `background-color` will be set depending on the selected theme. The rest is up to you 😇

## Time for global styles 😼

`GlobalStyles.js`

```c
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

export const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
   body {
     font-family: "Monaco", monospace;
     background: ${({ theme }) => theme.background};
     color: ${({ theme }) => theme.color};
     transition: all 0.50s linear;
  }
`
```

***GlobalStyles*** defines the global styles for our app. They will be injected into our app by in `App.js`.

Note that for this purpose, we'll import the ***createGlobalStyle*** helper from *styled-components*, which will create a new styled component that will handle global styles.

Regarding the properties, background and text colors will be retrieved from the theme. We'll also add a *transition* property to make the switch effect smoother.

## Creating the theme toggler 💁

`ThemeToggler.js`

```c
import React from 'react';
import Button from "./Button";

const ThemeToggler = (props) => {
   const { themeToggler } = props;
   return (
      <Button onClick={themeToggler}>Switch Theme ☀️ 🌙</Button>
   );
};

export default ThemeToggler;
```

***ThemeToggler*** renders the Button component and provides it with the style properties that correspond to the passed-in theme.

`useDarkTheme.js`

```c
import { useState } from 'react';

const THEMES = {
   LIGHT: "light",
   DARK: "dark"
}

const useDarkTheme = () => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState(THEMES.LIGHT);
    const themeToggler = () => {
        theme === THEMES.LIGHT ? setTheme(THEMES.DARK) : setTheme(THEMES.LIGHT);
    };
    return [theme, themeToggler];
};

export default useDarkTheme;
```

***useDarkTheme*** is a custom hook that contains the logic for our toggler. We're using a hook to abstract our app as much as possible.

The switching procedure is as easy as follows: if the passed-in theme is *light*, the *dark* theme will be set up, and vice versa.

## Building the main app 😈

`App.js`

```c
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";
import { GlobalStyles } from "./components/GlobalStyles";
import { lightTheme, darkTheme } from "./themes";
import ThemeToggler from "./components/ThemeToggler";
import useDarkTheme from "./hooks/useDarkTheme";

const App = () => {
   const [theme, themeToggler] = useDarkTheme();
   const selectedTheme = theme === 'light' ? lightTheme : darkTheme;

   return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={selectedTheme}>
         <>
            <GlobalStyles />
            <ThemeToggler themeToggler={themeToggler} />
            <p>Trying out light and dark themes! 😍</p>
         </>
      </ThemeProvider>
   )
}
export default App;
```

First, we're calling the *useDarkTheme* hook, that will handle the switch logic.

Then, we also need to have a function *selectedTheme*, that decides which theme is going to be used.

And now, what's only left is to wrap up *ThemeToggler* with ***ThemeProvider*** and include ***GlobalStyles***.

## The result ☀️ ➡️ 🌙
